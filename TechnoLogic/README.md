## Problem Statement

According to statistics from the RBI, about 80% of the Indian populaation does not have a credit score. This leads to heavy exploitation and high mortgage and interest prices on the loans taken by this faction. With such a huge Indian populace unable to participate in the formal financial sector, we miss out on countless new ideas, businesses, and innovations. We believe every person deserves the opportunity to take charge of their financial life. 


## Solution Approach

Powered by advanced data science, we have built a modern credit infrastructure from scratch. Our target audience consists of those people who have an android smartphone but dont have a credit score, statisticlly about 38% of the Indian population. Now, even they can apply for a loan and receive an instant decision, regardless of their credit history. The application takes only minutes and calculates the credit score pretty precisely.

This proves to be a win-win situation for all as the consumers get access to proper loans and the banks get new customers, thus increasing their overall profits.
